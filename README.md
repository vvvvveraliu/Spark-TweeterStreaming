### Streaming Architecture

The architecture is as follows. A socket requests data from Twitter API and sends data to the Spark streaming process. Spark reads real-time data to do analysis. It also saves temp 
streaming results to Google Storage. After the streaming process terminates, Spark reads the final data from Google Storage and saves it to BigQuery, and then cleans the data in Storage. 
Finally, we use LDA to classify the data in the streaming.



### Tasks: 
1.
2. Identify Trending Twitter Hashtags
